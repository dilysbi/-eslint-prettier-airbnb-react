Hi! 

[source](https://github.com/dilysbi/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react).

If you would like improve this shell script (or any other part of this repo), you can:

1. Fork this repo.
2. Create a new branch and make your local commits with clear messages, limiting a single commit to 1 specific issue.
3. Create a pull request with an explanation.
4. The pull request will be reviewed and merged to the master branch if everything looks good. 

Thanks!
